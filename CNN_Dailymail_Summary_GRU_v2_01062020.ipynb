vegetable with little dumplings roasted red peppers rice salads and vegetable stews benito mussolini had dictator benito mussolini been given the chance to rule the world he would have made all his subjects eat an italian diet according to the book he once said that french cooking was worthless and italian the best in the world mussolini thought italian food was the best in the world and his family favourite dessert right does look tasty but that does not mean he feasted on pasta and pizza one of his favourite dishes was less appetising salad of roughly chopped raw garlic dressed with oil and lemon the authors reveal that mussolini tyranny may have ended earlier than 1945 if he had not made changes to his diet they explained how he was diagnosed with an enlarged liver heightened blood sugar and deformed colon but revised diet that included rabbit and chicken brought about startling improvement saddam hussein fish was favourite dish of the notorious leader of iraq who ruled with iron fist from 1937 to 2006 the books reveals he could eat it at any time of the day and loved it as fresh as possible saddam hussein loved his fish cooked fresh so he would often make his staff grill it for him as early as 5am the recipe book reveals how to cook one of his favourites carp right they state on occasion he would rouse his kitchen staff at five or six in the morning to grill some fish he would just caught his callous murderous attitude was even revealed when he ate as the book reveals how once as he chewed olives he told his former chief of intelligence he was spitting out the

milk but clark and scott observe that the beauty treatment came with unfortunate side effects vain gaddafi used to drink camel milk to enhance the whiteness of his teeth the camel milk gaddafi liked to drink may have enhanced the brilliant whiteness of his smile but it seems to have played havoc with his digestion whether he suffered from uncontrollable flatulence or whether on the other hand he was able to exploit this affliction to emphasize whatever point he was engaged in making as demonstrated in an interview with john simpson is debatable certainly on visit to his tent in 2004 tony blair was advised not to accept glass of camel milk lest he be similarly afflicted they write one of his favourite meals was dish from his home country camel meat with couscous but he also had penchant for italian food despite banishing italians from libya kim jong il the recipe book reveals how the former leader of north korea was as fastidious as he was cruel they write hundreds of his luckless people were recruited to the project of preserving his health and vigour by way of his diet small army of women was employed to see that every grain of rice destined for his plate was uniform in size shape and colour kim jong il would often feast while his people starved shark fin soup was one of his favourite dishes but as they are now protected species the cookery cook recommends using soy or chicken breast instead it then had to be cooked over fire using only trees cut from mountain peak near the chinese border he loved sushi and it was once reported he enjoyed raw fish so fresh that he could start eating it when its mouth was still gasping and its tail still thrashing more evidence of his cruelty is shown by the way he had live lobsters airlifted to his train as it crossed siberia on its way to moscow and he had food grown for him alone while north koreans starved bon appetit camel meat serves six ingredients tbsp olive oil medium onions finely chopped can of chickpeas

is to make the world cup squad lancaster said we have some very good centres who will have something to say about that and he will have to learn quickly but he mentally strong if he can learn the game he ll bring an invaluable amount to the group he is very very good player and an impressive person what stands out for me is his mental toughness and strength the desire to dominate his opposite

with someone as special player like that is definitely appealing genia said burgess far left with mother julie and brothers luke george and thomas after the 2014 nrl grand final the bath star celebrates with russell crowe after the rabbitohs won the nrl grand final match in sydney you saw the type of character he was in that nrl grand final you always want to play with guys who are

saracens and england winger chris ashton sam an exception if you watch him play league he the best player on the pitch every single time there aren many players like that he up there with sonny bill williams time will tell but whatever burgess achieves in union and however long he sticks around the mark he has left in australia where league is king is indelible people talk about sam becoming the
